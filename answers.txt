Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an example and how it 
might help.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the field of athletics, in order to be
able to better understand and analyze the performance of athletes. Because
data science is the practice of using data to predict an outcome, we might be
able to use data science in sports to predict athlete performance, the 
likelihood of a certain play being completed successfully by a team, or
predicting who might be more likely to win a game. 

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

maintains a linear history.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?
